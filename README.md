# Foundations of Data Science Lab Work

This repository contains the lab work for the **Foundations of Data Science** course. Each file represents a standalone lab exercise or project, covering essential data science concepts such as data cleaning, analysis, statistical methods, and introductory machine learning.

## Table of Contents

Each lab or exercise is saved as a separate file. Below is a list of available lab files with a brief description (update as needed):

- `Assignment1.ipynb`
- `Assignment2.ipynb`
- `Assignment3.ipynb`
- `Assignment4.ipynb`
- `Assignment5.ipynb`

### Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you’ll need:

- **Python** (3.7 or later)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and other relevant libraries depending on each exercise.

### Running the Lab Notebooks

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sushilbang/Foundation-of-Data-Science.git
   cd Foundation-of-Data-Science
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open any `.ipynb` file from the repository to start exploring.

## Contents

The labs cover the following topics:

- **Data Wrangling and Cleaning**: Learn to preprocess data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use summary statistics and visualization techniques to explore data patterns and distributions.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Work on probability and statistical measures.
- **Machine Learning Basics**: Get started with basic machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Visualization**: Practice creating meaningful visualizations to represent data insights effectively.
